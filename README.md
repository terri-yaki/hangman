# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game repository! This is a simple and fun word guessing game you can play right in your terminal. Try your best to guess the word before your man gets hung!

## Getting Started

To get started with this game, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/terri-yaki/hangman.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the repository's directory:

```
cd hangman
```

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the game, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Play

To play the game, simply run the Python script with:

```
python hangman.py
```

Once the game starts, you will be prompted to guess letters one at a time. After every guess, the game will reveal whether the letter is part of the word or not. If the letter is in the word, it will appear in its correct position(s). If not, a part of the hangman gets drawn. The goal is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
