# Hangman

Welcome to the Hangman game repository! This is a simple implementation of the classic word guessing game where the objective is to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

## How to Play

To play the game, clone the repository onto your local machine and run the provided Python script. You will then be prompted to guess a letter. Keep guessing one letter at a time, and the game will let you know if your guess is correct or not. The game continues until you either guess the word correctly, or you run out of attempts and the hangman is fully drawn.
